I am a second-year Master's student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, with research experience in both natural language processing and computer vision. In natural language processing, I am particularly interested in large language models (LLMs), particularly in advancing their ability to think like humans. In computer vision, I focus on medical imaging, particularly in 3D clinical reconstruction. I earned my Bachelor's degree from Yao Class at Tsinghua University.
